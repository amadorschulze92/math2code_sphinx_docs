Introduction
============

Many companies face a shortage of engineers with strong capabilities in reading
and converting mathematical notation often found in academic papers and online
articles into working machine learning code. Conversely, there are many
academics with strong math backgrounds, but lack the necessary programming
skills to contribute in the industry setting.  Furthermore, there are many
students in the educational setting that would appreciate a tool to help them
easily convert math notation to code.

This web application allows a user to upload a picture of hand-written or
digital text of mathematical equations and generate its Python code equivalent.
